# PharmaTrackr
Focused on medication tracking and custom medication creation

# Project Notes
PharmaTrackr is a small project that I came up with built with Laravel and Filament. I've always used Apple Watch to track medications however in the Chinese culture, there are alot of medications that aren't widely available. I've worked with Filament and Laravel in other projects and thought that it might be easier to build one myself. While this might not cover your needs, you might find it helpful in some capacity. 

# Having issues?
For support, create a issue on GitHub to be easily tracked. Our roadmap isn't published yet but may be on GitHub or Trello.
